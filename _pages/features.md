    excerpt: 'The mesoSPIM is an axially scanned light-sheet microscope (ASLM) for uniform z-resolution across the FOV. In ASLM,
    the waist of the light-sheet is scanned through the sample in synchrony with the rolling shutter readout of the camera.'

    excerpt: 'The mesoSPIM has a vertical sample rotation axis similar to the original SPIM. This allows 360Â° rotation of the
    sample without changing the direction of gravity. This avoids any rotation-induced distortions of soft samples.
    Shown is a multi-color acquisition (Alexa 594 & Autofluorescence excited at 405 nm) of a 7-day old chick
    embryo stained for neurofilament and cleared using BABB. '

    excerpt: 'The mesoSPIM-control software is open-source and based on Python and PyQt5. It allows control
    of the ASLM mode and contains an acquisition manager, a table-based tool to create complex multichannel,
    multiview or tiling acquisitions.'

    title: "Mounting and exchanging samples is easy"
    excerpt: 'The current generation of the mesoSPIM uses a 1x air objective (Olympus MVPLAPO1x). Samples are
    inserted from the top into an immersion cuvette (bottom) filled with a refractive index matching solution.   
    The sample holders use kinematic mounts with magnets and can be exchanged within seconds. For CLARITY,
    samples are typically inserted into a sample cuvette (shown here), whereas hard samples (i.e. with iDISCO or BABB clearing)
    are clamped in a 3D-printed holder.'

    a whole CLARITY-cleared mouse CNS. Using the rotation stage, multi-view imaging can be performed in
    such large samples.'
