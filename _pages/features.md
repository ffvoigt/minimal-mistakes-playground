    excerpt: 'The mesoSPIM is an axially scanned light-sheet microscope (ASLM) for uniform z-resolution across the FOV. In ASLM,
    the waist of the light-sheet is scanned through the sample in synchrony with the rolling shutter readout of the camera.'

    title: "Capable of multiview imaging"
    excerpt: 'The mesoSPIM has a vertical sample rotation axis similar to the original SPIM. This allows 360Â° rotation of the
    sample without changing the direction of gravity. This avoids any rotation-induced distortions of soft samples.'
