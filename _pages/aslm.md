    the varying thickness of the lightsheet leads to axially blurred features
    at the edges of the field of view.'

    title: "Axially scanned light-sheet microscopy (ASLM)"
    excerpt: 'In axially scanned light-sheet microscopy (ASLM), the waist of
    the light-sheet is translated through the sample in synchrony with
    the rolling shutter of the camera. The concept was published in 2015 by
    Dean et al. (Fiolka group). To translate the waist, we use tuneable lenses
    by Optotune. At the refractive index of a CLARITY-cleared sample (n=1.45)
    and using 488 nm illumination, the mesoSPIM achieves an axial resolution of **6.55 Î¼m
    across a 13.3 mm FOV**.'

    excerpt: 'Here, a XZ view of a VIP-tdTomato mouse brain (cleared using passive
      CLARITY) shows the axial
    blurring of neurons gradually increasing from the center to the edges
    of the FOV. Cells in the center are well resolved in z as they are close to the
    waist locatation of the light-sheet. Cells at the edges, however, are blurred
    and indistinguishable due to the thicker light-sheet. '
