## Mission
The ‘mesoscale selective plane illumination microscopy’ (mesoSPIM) initiative aims
to provide the imaging community with open-source light-sheet microscopes for
large cleared samples. On the one hand, it is aimed at neuroscientists and
developmental biologists seeking high-quality anatomical data from cleared samples, on
the other hand, it strives to provide instrumentation developers with  
imaging platforms that can be tailored towards specific needs – i.e. to accommodate
uncommonly large samples or different illumination schemes.

In addition, we

## Team

Fabian F. Voigt is a PhD student in the laboratory of Fritjof Helmchen at
the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich. As a Bsc student, Fabian started
out building light-sheet endoscopes, countless two-photon microscopes 

Fritjof Helmchen is Professor of Neuroscience and Co-Director of the Brain Research Institute.
His research is focused on the development and application of optical methods, in
particular two-photon microscopy, to study neural activity on the subcellular, cellular, and circuit level. His group has pioneered several microscopy techniques, including 3D, high-speed, and multi-area in vivo two-photon imaging, and has contributed to recent advancements in the study of cortical microcircuits.
