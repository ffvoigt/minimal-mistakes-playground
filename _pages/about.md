## Mission
The ‘mesoscale selective plane illumination microscopy’ (mesoSPIM) initiative aims
to provide the imaging community with open-source light-sheet microscopes for
large cleared samples. On the one hand, it is aimed at neuroscientists and
developmental biologists seeking high-quality anatomical data from cleared samples, on
the other hand, it strives to provide instrumentation developers with imaging platforms
that can be tailored towards specific needs – i.e. to accommodate
uncommonly large samples or different illumination schemes.

In addition, we foster interactions between the developers of clearing methods,
instrumentation designers and users by organizing [meetings and workshops](/meetings_and_workshops/).

## History
In late 2015, the mesoSPIM project started as a tiny side project for Fabian Voigt when  
[Adriano Aguzzi](http://www.en.neuropathologie.usz.ch/) (University Hospital Zurich) approached [Fritjof
Helmchen](https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html) (Brain Research Institute, Zurich)  with
a request for help in the selection of a light-sheet microscope for CLARITY-cleared mouse brains.
After some unsatisfactory tests of existing commercial setups, we decided to build our own.

## Team
![image-left]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/authors/voigt3.jpg){: .align-left}Fabian F. Voigt is a PhD student in the laboratory of Fritjof Helmchen at
the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich. As a BSc student in Interdisciplinary
Science, Fabian started out building light-sheet endoscopes for in vivo calcium imaging
in mice. He then switched to designing and building two-photon mesoscopes
and femtosecond lasers in his MSc studies at ETH
Zurich. The mesoSPIM initative is part of his PhD studies at the University of Zurich.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/authors/FHelmchen_2012_crop_small2.jpg){: .align-left}Fritjof Helmchen is Professor of Neuroscience and Co-Director of the Brain Research Institute.
His research is focused on the development and application of optical methods, in
particular two-photon microscopy, to study neural activity on the subcellular, cellular,
and circuit level. His group has pioneered several microscopy techniques, including
3D, high-speed, and multi-area in vivo two-photon imaging, and has contributed
to recent advancements in the study of cortical microcircuits.
Fritjof Helmchen is currently Director of the [Neuroscience Center Zurich](http://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html)
