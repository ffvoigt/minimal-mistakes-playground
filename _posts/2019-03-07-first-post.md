After a long wait, it is **finally time to retire** the "Coming-soon" page that was
displayed at mesospim.org and replace it with this new webpage!

Here, you'll find news around the mesoSPIM project, an open hardware initative
aimed at providing versatile mesoscopy platforms to image cm-sized cleared samples.

The mesospim.org webpage serves as a gateway for mesoSPIM resources:
* [mesoSPIM organization page](https://github.com/mesoSPIM) on Github
* mesoSPIM data acquisition software: [mesospim-control](https://github.com/mesoSPIM/mesoSPIM-control)
* [mesoSPIM documentation and wiki](https://github.com/mesoSPIM/mesoSPIM-hardware-documentation)
